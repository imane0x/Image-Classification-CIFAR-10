# Image Classification on CIFAR-10 dataset
In this project, we explored the applicability of three different approaches for tackling image classification problem on CIFAR-10 dataset:

- SVM classifier trained on HOG features.
- CNN-based model.
- Transfer learning with VGG-16.

# Results

| Model                   | Train accuracy | Test accuracy |
|-------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| HOG and SVM             | 82.5%          | 64.51%        |
| Traditional CNN        | 93.43%         | 88.58%        |
| Transfer Learning: VGG16| 98.62%         | 91.32%        |
